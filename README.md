# Pattern-Matching

There are four Pattern Matching Algoritms I used for DNA/Pattern matching. 
\n Each having differnt complexity and it based on their skipping part.

The Algorithms are \n
1. Brute-Force Pattern Matching Algorithm
2. Multiple Reference Character Algorithm (MRCA)
3. A FAST Pattren Matching Algorithm
4. Approximate Pattern Matching Algorithm
