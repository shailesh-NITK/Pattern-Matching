# Pattern-Matching

There are four Pattern Matching Algoritms I used for DNA/Pattern matching.Each having differnt complexity and it based on their skipping part.

The Algorithms are<br />
1. Brute-Force Pattern Matching Algorithm <br />
2. Multiple Reference Character Algorithm (MRCA) <br />
3. A FAST Pattren Matching Algorithm <br />
4. Approximate Pattern Matching Algorithm
